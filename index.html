			<h1>About Com-Com</h1>
			<h2>Safety with communication, guidance and independent riding.</h2>

			<div class="description">
				<p>Riding as a family brings a sense of freedom, exploration and bonding that
				results in lasting memories and healthy habits. However, family riding may not always be a “ride in the park,” especially for those with children who like to speed ahead. Many parents have experienced those helpless moments when their children ride too close to a busy road and think, “Will they hear me if I scream STOP”?</p>

				<p>Com-Com was developed to prevent these frightening situations by putting parents in direct communication with their children as if they are right next to them. Com-Com is specially made for easy communication using a convenient button on the handle bar grip so as to maintain balance and continued movement. Com-Com will allow parents to communicate with their child from a distance and convey safety through guidance.

			<h1>FAQs</h1>
			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<div class="content">
					<dl>
						<dt>Why are you doing this?</dt>
						<dd>The Rockaways are fairly isolated, and even with the help from FEMA and the Red Cross (who, in many cases, cannot go onto or in residents properties to help out), residents still need manpower to help distribute goods and help clear out their homes.
						<br>
						<br>
						We know there is a huge demand in the New York community to volunteer, but many find it hard to commute to Rockaway. Rockaway Relief wants to enable our local community to reach out and do something.
						</dd>

						<dt>Where do we meet and at what times?</dt>
						<dd>The pick-up and drop-off point is at <a href="http://thesmilenyc.com/" target="_blank">The Smile</a> at 26 Bond Street in Manhattan.
							<ul>
								<li>Departure for Rockaways check-in begins at 8:30AM. Vans leave at 9AM SHARP.</li>
								<li>Return to Manhattan check-in begins at 3:15PM. Vans leave at 3:30PM SHARP.</li>
							</ul>
							We will not wait for no shows.
